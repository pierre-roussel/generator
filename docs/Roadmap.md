# Roadmap

This package was created to üèéÔ∏èüí® **SPEED** up the creation of any `boilerplate` code / templates. This is a full rewrite of the Yeoman Generator I created nearly two years ago. It still works wonderfully actually, but as with all things there is room for improvement.

- [x] Move off of Yeoman as a dependency
- [x] Fully written in ES6 and TypeScript
- [x] Solid test coverage via Jest and TS
- [ ] Make it even more customizable for the end user
  - [ ] ability to create custom workflows and validation
- [ ] Document the naming pattern for re-naming a file
- [ ] Document custom values in the `.generator.config` file
- [ ] Experiment with a custom callback / creation hook
- [ ] Encapsulate into a single Class
- [ ] Swap out Sync for Async methods
- [ ] More graceful error handling and reporting
  - Fine with not overriding, maybe a prompt though
